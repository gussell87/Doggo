## Doggo User Story
As a dog lover: I want to search dog breed information. This includes height, weight, life-span, breed group, a description and a picture.
This is so I can get a better understanding of different species of dog, to know which is the right breed for me and my lifestyle.


## Getting Started 
Type all or part of a breed of dog into the box, and click the search button! Up to five matches will appear below. Click the variety you wish to see information for. You will then be able to view key characteristics, a photo and description for your chosen breed.
